- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jawad-RoboLearn, currently pursuing my PhD in Mechanical and Automation Engineering with majors in Robotics and Control.
- 👀 I’m interested in developing robotic control systems theoratically and numerically. Besides, I am developing some Robotics related codes in Matlab, Python, C++ and ROS framework.
- 🌱 I actively learn the new coding frameworks in Robotics especially ROS, ROS2 and others.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on research in "Agile Locomotion", "Agile Locomotion - Robust Learning Frameworks", "Agile Locomotion - Model Free Learning"
- 📫 you can reach me at jmbstjtu@mae.cuhk.edu.hk
